# Abstract
This project presents the development of TerraTek, an IoT-based monitoring system designed to assist a customer in tracking environmental data. The system utilizes Arduino-controlled sensor clusters to gather data on key parameters such as rainfall, water pH, water level, and so on, which are then transmitted to a centralized server. A responsive web interface allows users to visualize data trends and generate reports to aid decision-making processes. Through data analysis, the project demonstrates improved statistics by utilizing historical and real-time data. Future work will involve extending the system’s capabilities to include real-time camera monitoring based on sensor data.

# Backround
The TerraTek project originated from a local initiative in the Texas Panhandle, where a resident sought a rainwater harvesting system to address water scarcity and promote sustainable practices. Recognizing the critical need for innovative solutions in a region often affected by drought, multiple professors supported the development of TerraTek as part of a broader effort to implement systems that assist with water conservation and management.​

TerraTek combines IoT technology with Arduino-controlled sensor clusters to monitor environmental parameters such as rainfall, water pH, and water levels. The data collected is transmitted to a centralized server, allowing users to visualize trends and generate actionable reports through a responsive web interface. Designed to support decision-making, the system also leverages historical and real-time data for enhanced insights. Future expansions include integrating real-time camera monitoring to further optimize water resource management, contributing to sustainable solutions for drought-prone areas.
